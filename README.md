# LetterFrequency
This is a comprehensive study by the team of students from DPS RK Puram on the use of relative percentages of occurrence of letters to create an alphabet profile for the given cipher and using it to analyse a substitution effectively reducing the permutations to unity. The reduction is exponential with every step and the length of the text helps to improve accuracy. This technique can also be used to determine the time period in which a literary work was written, analyse the various styles used by the author of a certain piece of text, identify the language used in a given text without a language expert and observe the evolution of a language.
